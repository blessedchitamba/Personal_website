						<h1>About me</h1>
						<img src ="passportPic.jpg">
						<p>My name is Blessed Chitamba, the first born in a family of three (excluding parents; I'm still to have someone tell me if 'family of so-many' includes parents or not lol). I was born on the 26th of January in the year 1996, in the beloved country of Zimbabwe. 
						<br></br>

		I am fortunate to have been raised in a strong (trust me) Christian family, something which has formed the bulk of my personality and character. My parents say they have been strong, fervent Christians from their school days (which becomes evident once you live with them), and so they have made all efforts to pass that to us. I can count the total number of Sundays we have missed church with them in my whole life to be less than 7. Add that to the fact that they both became pastors and so they would tag us along to every other church related meeting. That’s still only half of it; our TV exposure was extremely monitored too, and then long frequent lectures. To be honest, at first I hated it, but now I wouldn’t want to imagine <em>what</em> sort of person I would be if not for that. Thank you so much Mum and Dad, you da best!!
		<br></br>

		Anyway, about my life, I completed my primary school education at Old Windsor Primary School and Greengrove Primary School. I was the smartest in class then. Wait, no, that’s not entirely true. I was only smartest at Greengrove; I was only second or third smartest at Old Windsor, yes. 
		<br></br>

		I did my high school at St Ignatius College for all 6 years. It was the best choice of school for me I believe. I have loads of funny tales about that place; see the link below for more on that. Anyway, at high school (and primary even) I was an introvert, and I sucked at sports, all of them. Thank God I didn’t suck in my academics otherwise I that would have been the worst. And trust me, I tried. Form one and two I tried a bit of football and athletics. With those two, I never qualified for any team in primary school so I thought maybe since I've come to a new school with new people, it might be different. How wrong I was. Form 3 I went into volleyball and a bit of rugby; didn’t work still. A level I tried swimming. 
		<br></br>

		Now I am at the University of Cape Town studying Computer Science. </p>

					<h3>I am a pianist!!</h3>
					<p>Well, pianist-still-learning that is. I only started playing in 2017 around early March. YouTube has been my teacher (Through the Holy Spirit of course!). I've always been a musician (who creates music in his mind only, that is, lol). Okay, musician is too strong a word; music appreciator is more like it. Maybe I'll be in the future. You can click below to see one of my early videos. </p>

				<div id="compsci" class = "interest">
					<h3>I love computer science stuff!</h3>
					<p>My first encounter with compsci stuff was in my second year of Mechanical Engineering, during the first semester, where we did an introduction to programming with Python course. I fell in love with it and a year later decided to switch majors into full time Computer Science, and I've been loving it. (Don't get me wrong, I loved MechEng too). I just am fascinated by the fundamental problems that computer science seeks to solve and how they are approached; data storage with data structures, algorithm efficiency, and so on. As things become more software, consumers' demands and expectations keep going up and hence the work of computer scientists never stops. </p>
